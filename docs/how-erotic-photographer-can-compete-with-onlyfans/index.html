Every year a new iPhone offers better hardware and software for producing photos and videos. The need for having an expensive DSLR or a full frame camera is diminishing quickly.</p></div><h3>Less expensive content distribution</h3><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>Today everyone has access to multiple platforms for content distribution that have huge audiences: TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, OnlyFans, PornHub.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>Everyone wants attention</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>Attention is the currency. You can convert to cash.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>There're two types of attention: free and paid.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>Free attention: TikTok, Instagram and YouTube Paid attention: OnlyFans and PornHub</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>There’re no gatekeepers anymore.</p></div><h3>What to should I do as a photographer?</h3><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>What should photographers do in the current market? How should photographers position themselves? What value should they offer?</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>Do what OnlyFans models can’t do.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>In your work:</p></div><ol><li>Tell a better story in your content: if OnlyFans models document and sell their real intimate life, then you should focus on creating and selling a fantasy. Create a fantasy, don’t document a real life.</li><li>Show a better location in your content: if OnlyFans models show their home and other places that they have access to, then you should scout and shoot at unusual and interesting locations only. Use more interesting outfits and other items in your content.</li><li>Create art erotica: focus on artistic aspect of erotica, and expand your audience to art lovers, rather than only focusing on erotica lovers.</li></ol><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>In your business:</p></div><ol><li>Easy: hire OnlyFans models to create content for your audience.</li><li>Medium: build relationship with people who would love to collaborate with you and create content for all involved.</li><li>Hard: build a prestigious brand that OnlyFans models would love to create content for.</li></ol><h3>Don’t compete on creating intimacy</h3><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>You can’t sell better intimacy than the model at her bedroom, bathroom or kitchen. Do not sell intimacy or connection with the model.</p></div><h3>Don’t compete on image quality</h3><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>With time iPhones will get even better at producing high quality photos and videos. Consumers won’t notice significant difference between content created with an iPhone and a full frame camera. There will be a difference, but not significant enough for consumer to choose quality over other benefits of OnlyFans content.</p></div><h3>Don’t compete on low effort content</h3><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>Don’t compete in low effort content that is easy to create. Competition is bad for you. Leave that market and focus on a different market with less competition that has a higher barrier of entrance. It can be a smaller market, but your results can be bigger.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>If it’s easy - don’t create it.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>Save your time and effort to content that is hard to create.</p></div><div class="col-sm-8 offset-sm-2"><hr></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>Share your thoughts in comments or get in touch with me via email: <a href="mailto:justdontgetboring@gmail.com">justdontbeboring@gmail.com</a>.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3"><p>Follow me on Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/JustDontBeBoring/">@JustDontBeBoring</a></p></div></div><div class="add-this-sharing-buttons"><!-- Go to www.addthis.com/dashboard to customize your tools --><div class="addthis_sharing_toolbox"></div></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
