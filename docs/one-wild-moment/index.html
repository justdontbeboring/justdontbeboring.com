He’s beta. How do we know that? Look at his face. It’s tense. He’s not relaxed. He’s driving the whole group to a vacation home, and he wants to impress them. It probably was his idea to spend summer holidays at his house, all together. He needs their company and their validation. He’s behaviour is needy from the start. He doesn’t look like he’s going to a vacation for himself to relax.</p><p>Then we meet the second dad. He’s alpha. He looks unimpressed, bored, relaxed. He’s not stressing about what’s coming up next. He’s not trying to force the outcome of this trip from the beginning. He’s open to whatever it’s going to be. This is the sign of confidence.</p><p>In their initial conversation, the beta dad immediately complains about the new houses that he didn’t see previously. He talks about how those new houses and hotels could ruin their holidays. He’s clearly worried about the outcome. The alpha dad, just answers: Yes. He doesn’t care about any of that. He asks him if the beta dad already visited the place. The beta dad says that of cause he was there before and he immediately says that the place is great. He seems like he doesn’t want to ruin any expectations that he has for this trip. The alpha dad is not impressed of his answer. He silently judges him, as in: why would you go to a vacation to a familiar place - don’t you want an unknown, an adventure?</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/3.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Now we’re meeting their daughters.</p><p>First we meet the alpha daughter.</p><p>She pays no attention to the alpha dad at this point.</p><p>The first daughter is feminine. She has long loose hair. She’s looking out of the window and day dreaming. She pays attention to the nature, enjoys it, she looks more present. We don’t see her using tech. She’s ready to fall in love, while the beta girl is ready to fuck.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/4.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Then we briefly meet the second daughter. She’s the opposite of the first daughter. She’s less feminine. Her hair are collected. She’s more orderly. She doesn’t pay attention to nature or to the outside world. She’s fully engaged with her phone.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/5.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The first daughter asks her father - how long until they’ll arrive. We learn that her father is the beta dad.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/6.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Then the beta dad starts telling the story of how he was going to local school and saving money to buy a bicycle.</p><p>Nobody wants to hear that story.</p><p>Notice the music the girls are listening to - it's a modern techno music.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/7.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Now we see that the alpha dad pays attention to the cute daughter for the first time.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/8.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/9.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad points out to the beta dad that their daughters don’t care about the story.</p><p>When they arrived the beta daughter asks her alpha father if he wants to carry her bag - that’s a shit test. The alpha dad answers: dream on.</p><p>We learn a bit about beta dad’s father - he wasn’t doing much - eating and sleeping. This tells us about the role model that the beta dad had as a father. He clearly wants to be seen as someone better than his father.</p><p>The beta dad keeps praising the house and the view. Asking for that validation.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/10.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The girls are not impressed. They’re bored.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/11.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Then we see the first shit test from the alpha daughter. She’s checking her phone and complains that there’re no WiFi.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/12.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad reacts. He judges her daughter’s generation in a playful manner, like he’s saying stereotypical things about generations on purpose. He challenges them, i.e. “Is your generation good enough? Are you good enough?” This is a push.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/13.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Both daughters react positively. They smile.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/14.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The beta girl’s reaction is boring, she drops the ball. The alpha girl, on the other hand - continues to play alpha dad’s narrative, she extends her shit test, talking about ghosts in this old house. She pulls the alpha dad.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/15.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad laughs. He doesn’t try to defend his point of view or his generation or this house. He participates in the fun push-pull exchange.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/16.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The beta dad is not involved in this fun push-pull exchange.</p><p>Then the alpha girl does another shit test addressed to the alpha dad. She asks him how to politely say “fuck off”, while she’s looking into alpha dad’s eyes.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/17.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She’s building tension here. For the first time the communication is one-on-one: the alpha girl vs an alpha dad.</p><p>The alpha dad plays along and answer her question in a fun, playful manner. Clearly communicating that he’s up for building a playful tension between the two.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/18.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The beta dad looks at that conversation and has no idea of the playful tension that builds up in front of him between the two. He seriously asks his friend whether he likes the place.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/19.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad replies with irony that sure, he likes the place.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/20.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha girl likes alpha dad’s ironic answer and she’s for the first time clearly interested in the alpha dad. He’s now fun in her eyes. And so far - the only fun thing about this whole trip.</p><p>So far alpha dad passed her shit tests.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/21.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Then alpha dad takes the lead in the conversation. He switches his attention from the girl and points to the guns in the cupboard. That’s a push. It’s like he says: “We had fun and now I will switch my attention to something else.”</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/22.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha girl then jumps into their conversation. She says that she loves guns, while looking at the alpha guy, not at the guns. She’s now trying to qualify herself to the alpha guy.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/23.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The second girl is passive, she is not involved in the exchange.</p><p>The beta guy gives a gun to his daughter - the alpha girl.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/24.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She asks how to load the shotgun. The beta dad shows her. In that moment the alpha dad criticises him for teaching his daughter how to load a gun. That’s a pull.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/25.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She then points the gun at alpha dad and asks him if he’s scared.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/26.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/27.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>This is another shit test. Will he hold the dominant frame in a life-death situation? Or will he submit to her frame?</p><p>With holding and pointing the gun, the alpha girl raises the degree of tension between the two.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/28.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/29.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad didn’t budge, he faced the gun and stood still. Shit test passed.</p><p>The girls went into their room and saw there a dead rat, naturally, they screamed.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/30.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/31.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad picks the rat and says: don’t panic we’ll get rid of all of them.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/32.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha girl does another shit test. She challenges him by asking him whether they want to kill the whole family of that rat?</p><p>The alpha dad doesn’t seek her validation, so he doesn’t explain himself, but rather plays along and bring the dead rat closer to the alpha girl to scare her. This is a pull.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/33.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Needless to say that the alpha dad passes the shit tests. Everyone laughs at the end of that exchange.</p><p>The next exchange happens when the girls complaint about no TV, no WiFi. Music is playing in the room. The alpha dad in the room starts cheering them up, saying how awesome the place is. He has a very upbeat playful vibe. Girls are smiling.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/34.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Then the alpha dad starts to dance, and the girls join him.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/35.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>In that moment the beta dad walks in, turns off the music and shuts down the fun. He then complaints about his wife. In that conversation we learn that beta dad didn’t like his dad, but respected him.</p><p>-</p><p>When girls get into taxi to go out to a club, the alpha dad asks them if they know what will happen if they come back late. The alpha girl plays along and asks him: what?</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/36.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad playfully grabs her face. This is the first time they escalate their communication to physical touches.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/37.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>In the taxi, the alpha girl says that the beta’s girl dad is cool. The beta girl replies that alpha girl’s dad is not cool.</p><p>-</p><p>We see both fathers together in the kitchen. The alpha dad is siting with his leg on the table drinking beer. The beta dad washes dishes.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/38.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad explains to his friend that beta dad’s daughter and his wife are family and the man doesn’t fit into their relationship. He will always be an outsider and they won’t share with him what they share between themselves.</p><p>-</p><p>Climbing down the waterfall. Instructor tells the group that they’re approaching the “lovers waterfall” and they need to split into pairs. The alpha dad goes first. Then the beta dad tells his alpha daughter that she’ll come with him (the beta dad). The girl objects, saying that this is a “lovers waterfall” and join the alpha dad. We don’t see alpha dad objecting and supporting her.</p><p>When the alpha dad and the alpha daughter climb down the waterfall, the alpha girl starts saying that she’s scared and that the alpha dad needs to hold her. This is her asking for attention and for the alpha dad to act as her protector - a classic masculine role. This is another test shit by her. The alpha dad is playing along.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/39.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Not only the alpha dad is holding her, he’s also telling her to look into his eyes, presumably, so that she wouldn’t feel scared. What’s happening is he’s bringing her closer into his frame.</p><p>Compare this scene with the one where the alpha girl acted more masculine when she held a shotgun. In this scene, she’s the complete opposite - vulnerable feminine asking for protection from a stronger masculine.</p><p>This is a classic dynamic between the two sexes, where feminine asking masculine for protection.</p><p>And this is the first time they’re so close together in a dangerous life-death situation.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/40.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad is leading them down the waterfall.</p><p>What about the beta dad? He and the beta daughter are looking down at how the alpha dad and alpha daughter are climbing down the waterfall. The beta daughter’s scared. The beta dad asks her if she’s scared and she says no, which is clearly a lie, as she looks scared. Then the beta dad repeats her answer as if he didn’t expect her to be not scared and then he jokingly says that he’s scared. This is an example of a self-deprecation. The beta dad belittles himself to make the female feel more masculine and confident than she actually is, at his own expense. The beta dad mistakenly believes that making female look more “courageous” than himself will win her sympathy for him and ease her discomfort in this risky situation. Which is a mistake, as in that dangerous situation female would like to have a stronger and more confident male next to her and we see such example - the alpha pair of dad and the daughter.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/41.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>When the alpha dad and alpha daughter finally reach the bottom of the waterfall, they relax and wait for other pair to climb down. The alpha dad lies down with his hands wide open and the alpha daughter tries to lie down next to him on one of his hand, as if he’s hugging her. He quickly removes his hand to prevent that intimacy.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/42.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/43.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>He then praises her, says that he didn’t expect her to perform so well. This is a pull from the alpha dad.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/44.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She doesn’t say anything, but she gives him a seductive look, wishing he would kiss her in that moment. At this point she’s sexually attracted to the alpha dad. This is the highest tension between the two we’ve seen so far.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/45.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>When they all change, and take their wetsuits off, the alpha girl escalates the sexual tension between the two. She innocently stares at him, while taking her wetsuit off and casually flashing one of her boobs for him. This is a pull.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/46.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad helps his own daughter to unzip her wetsuit and when he sees the alpha girl half-topless, he acts as if it’s all cool and no big deal for him. Unlike her, he doesn’t stare. He looks away for a moment and then briefly looks at her again - all as if there’s nothing interesting to see.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/47.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/48.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/49.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad starts to feel the sexual tension too.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/50.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha girl then smiles and acts as if she have just noticed that she’s flashing her boob. She doesn’t turn away or cover herself in any way - instead she slowly fixes her bikini - all while seductively staring at the alpha dad. This is her pulling and raising sexual tension between them.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/51.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/52.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad reacts positively. He doesn’t judge her or displays any amount of shame in what’s happening. On the opposite, he participates in this game.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/53.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>All while the beta dad sits further away from the group and argues with his wife on a phone. The wife has decided to have a holiday separately form the beta husband and the beta husband is frustrated about that.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/54.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>-</p><p>While driving in the car on their way back home we see the alpha girl falling in love with the alpha guy. The alpha guy is chilling, not paying any attention to her.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/55.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>But she can’t stop looking at him. So far they’ve built the tension and they didn’t release it.</p><p>The music that she presumably listens to is Rihanna a modern pop music.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/56.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>-</p><p>When the group walks the town street in the evening, we learn that the alpha girl is 17 and that the beta dad knows and likes another woman that both dads see on the street.</p><p>They agree that the alpha dad will take both daughters to the party on the beach.</p><p>-</p><p>When the alpha dad and two daughters arrive to the party the alpha dad immediately tells that them that the party sucks and they should all go home. Clearly, we see that the party is cool and the dad wants to stay, but has to act as a dad and pretend that he doesn’t like it.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/57.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The girls ignore what he says and his beta daughter asks him for money. He gives the money, playing the role of provider for his daughter. Immediately we forget that a few seconds earlier he suggested that the party sucks and they should go home.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/58.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Before the girls go partying the beta girl kisses her dad on a cheek, while the alpha girl gives him an air kiss.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/59.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Once the girls left, the alpha dad starts acting as if he actually enjoys the party.</p><p>-</p><p>In the meantime, the beta dad back at that street finally approaches the women he knows and likes. In his approach he jokes that she follows him and he will call the cops. This is a push. He sets the frame and brings her into his frame, but then…</p><p>She calls him out on walking around for the last 10 minutes and not having confidence to approach her. He happily dismisses his own frame and accepts her frame and plays along. He jokingly explains himself - he says that what seems to be his lack of confidence is actually not that, but he couldn’t decide what to pick: chocolate or yam. He self-deprecates him, after she already deprecated him. He believes that his inability to make a decision somehow should be attractive and funny to the girl. Indeed, she laughs, but arguably - at his expense. This is a strong beta behaviour.</p><p>Then she leads the rest of the conversation.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/60.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>-</p><p>Back at the beach party the alpha dad is being approached by a hot mature woman who’s closer to his age. She leads the conversation and buys him drinks.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/61.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/62.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha daughter notices the competition.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/63.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She find the beta daughter who’s a daughter of the alpha dad and tries to make her interrupt the flirting between the alpha dad and the mature woman by suggesting that “it’s a problem”. She complains that he’s picking up a woman for himself.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/64.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The daughter of the alpha dad is actually happy about that as she wants to sleep with her a guy she met and wants her dad to be busy with someone else.</p><p>The alpha daughter complains that that woman is old and ugly. Notice how women will put down other women in their intersexual competition. She attacks her age and her looks straight away, without knowing anything else about her.</p><p>The daughter of the alpha dad doesn’t care that her dad is hooking up with another women. The alpha girl runs up to him dancing and asks him to go home.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/65.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She pulls him away from the older woman.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/66.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>-</p><p>In the mean time the beta dad tells his date that they should kiss. He asks for a kiss. He acts needed. His date shit tests him. She mentions that he’s married because he wears a ring. He starts to explain himself to her. She’s not impressed.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/67.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/68.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>-</p><p>Back at the beach party, the alpha dad takes an alcohol test to see if he can drives. The girls come over and his beta daughter asks if she can leave with her friends. The dad asks the alpha daughter is she wants to go with her, but the alpha girl wants to stay with him. He lets the beta daughter go with her friends.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/69.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Now the alpha dad and alpha daughter are left together. She asks him to order drinks.</p><p>-</p><p>The beta dad on his way home in a taxi argues with his wife on a phone. She’s in a bar with her new friends. The beta dad doesn’t trust her and asks her to come join them.</p><p>-</p><p>The alpha dad is drunk and he dances with the alpha girl. They’re now much closer to each other. Dancing together, holding hands and hugging.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/70.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>They walk on a beach and Luna invites him to go for a swim.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/71.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The dad says no and gives an excuse that the water is cold. She starts taking down her clothes.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/72.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/73.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Then she throws her clothes at him.</p><p>She keeps inviting him to join her for a swim while she strips in front of him. The dad says no, but with less and less conviction.</p><p>She then asks if he would like her to “dance” for him. The guy says no.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/74.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/75.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>He stares at her dancing. He smiles and his expression says that he likes what he sees. He gives on all excuses and just stops talking at this point.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/76.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She gives him another shit test. She says: “don’t look at me that way”. He doesn’t explains himself, plays along and replies: “what way?”</p><p>He’s now in her frame. She commands him to join her for a swim and escalates her seduction efforts - she takes her bra off.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/77.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She asks him if he’s shy about it. This is another shit test from her. He says no, but acts shy and turns away for a few seconds while she’s staring at him, getting naked and throwing her underwear at him.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/78.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>He can’t resist looking at her.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/79.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She gets naked and starts walking into the sea, while trying to convince him to join her.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/80.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She shames him for being so shy. The alpha dad can’t come up with more excuses why he can’t join her.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/81.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She asks him not to leave her alone in the sea, the dad looks around to see if anyone will see him and finally gives up.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/82.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She then loudly comments on him stripping. She escalates the situation, making it feel more dangerous than it is.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/83.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She then shit tests him again, commenting on his underwear. The alpha dad fails this test. He explain that his wife bought it for him and it’s not his fault. She owns the frame completely and he’s in her frame.</p><p>She then gives him another shit test. She challenges him to take his underwear off.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/84.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>He pushes back on her pull and tells her that he won’t be completely naked in front of her. He passes her “monkey-dance” shit test.</p><p>To not look needy, she tells him that she doesn’t really care if he takes it off or not. Yet, she continues to try to convince him to take it off, by displaying her own nudity and displaying that it’s not a big deal.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/85.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad ignores her demands to take his underwear off - he’s holding his frame.</p><p>She then playfully tries to pull his underwear off herself. She raises the level of intimacy between the two. The alpha dad playfully pushes her away from him.</p><p>She then catches him off-guard and kisses him.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/86.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>After a few second of kissing the alpha dad pushes her away.</p><p>She then retreats to the beach, walking away from him. That’s a push from her side.</p><p>At the beach she acts as an innocent and vulnerable girl. This is a complete opposite from how she behaved when she was stripping in front of him. Now she attracts his attention by displaying need for care and protection. She’s creating a new frame and pulling him into her frame.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/87.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha dad follows into that frame. He starts apologising for how he behaved. They both talk about crossing a boundary, yet, they sit together, as a couple, very closely to each other - naked.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/88.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The alpha girl starts complaining how nobody understands her - except for him. She plays a victim role and assigns a saviour role to him. The alpha dad is still in her frame and he doesn’t reject it.</p><p>He hugs her to protect her from cold and they get intimately close to each other again - the first time since the kiss in the sea.</p><p>The alpha dad suggests they go home and Luna attempts to kiss him again.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/89.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>This time he’s not giving her a kiss, but he doesn’t walk away either.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/90.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Luna escalates. The alpha dad asks her to stop, but he doesn’t prevent her from continuing kissing him. She pushes him to the ground.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/91.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She continues kissing him and he’s not preventing her from doing so, yet he’s not participating in it. He’s hands are in the air, not holding her.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/92.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>And after a few more seconds of kissing - the alpha dad gives up. He now participates and his hands hold her back.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/93.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>She takes his hands and puts them on her bum.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/94.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>After making out, they’re lying down as a couple and Luna tells the guy that she’s in love.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/95.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>When two of them drive home, the alpha girl is happy and the alpha dad is concerned.</p><p>Notice the music that is playing that the girl enjoys. It's on old song from 1974 - Les Mots Bleus by Christophe. This song is from the alpha dad's generation and now that the girl is in love with the alpha dad - she's in love with the music from his generation. Remember that earlier the girl was listening to modern techno music.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/96.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>When they arrive home, the beta dad meets them. Luna kisses alpha dad on a cheek - in front of her father - and goes to sleep.</p><p>It’s clear that she’s not trying to hide her affection for the alpha dad from her own father.</p><p>-</p><p>Next morning Luna walks into breakfast table wearing Alpha dad’s underwear. As if she’s claiming “the ownership” - the Alpha dad is now hers.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/97.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>The Alpha dad’s daughter noticed the underwear and starts figuring out that something has happened between the two.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/98.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>Luna mentions that she likes Corsica, yet, at the beginning of the film she complained that this place was boring. Something has changed and the beta daughter is noticing change in her attitude.</p><figure class="figure"><img src="./images/99.jpeg" alt="One Wild Moment" class="figure-img img-fluid img-rounded"></figure><p>-</p><p>Share your thoughts in comments or get in touch with me via email: <a href="mailto:justdontgetboring@gmail.com">justdontbeboring@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>Follow me on Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/JustDontBeBoring/">@JustDontBeBoring</a></p></div></div><div class="add-this-sharing-buttons"><!-- Go to www.addthis.com/dashboard to customize your tools --><div class="addthis_sharing_toolbox"></div></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
