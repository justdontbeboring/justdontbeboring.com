# How Erotic Photographer Can Compete With OnlyFans?

_TL;DR: don’t compete with OnlyFans._

The tech startup world came to a conclusion that when you choose between a strong team, a strong product and a strong market - [choose a strong market](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html).

It will amplify your advantages and your results.

It will compensate for your disadvantages and bad luck.

What does it mean for a photographer or a film maker that creates art nude or erotic work?

### Know your market

Today the supply of erotic content that offers intimacy and connection with the model is done through OnlyFans and PornHub.

It used to be Playboy.

Not anymore.

The marker has changed and with new tech it’s changing fast.

What exactly is changing?

Two major changes:

1. Less expensive content production: cameras and software that help content creators to create high quality images and videos.
2. Less expensive content distribution: content distribution platforms that take a small cut and pay the rest to content creators.

### Less expensive content production

The cost of high quality image and video is dropping. Every year a new iPhone offers better hardware and software for producing photos and videos. The need for having an expensive DSLR or a full frame camera is diminishing quickly.

### Less expensive content distribution

Today everyone has access to multiple platforms for content distribution that have huge audiences: TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, OnlyFans, PornHub.

Everyone wants attention

Attention is the currency. You can convert to cash.

There're two types of attention: free and paid.

Free attention: TikTok, Instagram and YouTube
Paid attention: OnlyFans and PornHub

There’re no gatekeepers anymore.

### What to should I do as a photographer?

What should photographers do in the current market? How should photographers position themselves? What value should they offer?

Do what OnlyFans models can’t do.

In your work:

1. Tell a better story in your content: if OnlyFans models document and sell their real intimate life, then you should focus on creating and selling a fantasy. Create a fantasy, don’t document a real life.
2. Show a better location in your content: if OnlyFans models show their home and other places that they have access to, then you should scout and shoot at unusual and interesting locations only. Use more interesting outfits and other items in your content.
3. Create art erotica: focus on artistic aspect of erotica, and expand your audience to art lovers, rather than only focusing on erotica lovers.

In your business:

1. Easy: hire OnlyFans models to create content for your audience.
2. Medium: build relationship with people who would love to collaborate with you and create content for all involved.
3. Hard: build a prestigious brand that OnlyFans models would love to create content for.

### Don’t compete on creating intimacy

You can’t sell better intimacy than the model at her bedroom, bathroom or kitchen. Do not sell intimacy or connection with the model.

### Don’t compete on image quality

With time iPhones will get even better at producing high quality photos and videos. Consumers won’t notice significant difference between content created with an iPhone and a full frame camera. There will be a difference, but not significant enough for consumer to choose quality over other benefits of OnlyFans content.

### Don’t compete on low effort content

Don’t compete in low effort content that is easy to create. Competition is bad for you. Leave that market and focus on a different market with less competition that has a higher barrier of entrance. It can be a smaller market, but your results can be bigger.

If it’s easy - don’t create it.

Save your time and effort to content that is hard to create.
